# q&a
what is large language model?
large language models refer to large, general-purpose language models that can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.

what is a prompt?
A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.

what are foundation models in generative ai?
A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted” (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.

what is a generaive ai?
generative ai is a type of artificial intelligence (at) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio and video.

hallucinatios are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect. What are some factors that can cause halluciations? select three options.
* the model is not given enough context.
* the model is trained on noisy or dirty data.
* the model is not trained on enough data.

what is an example of both a geneartive ai model and a discriminative ai model?
a generative ai model coudl be trained on a dataset of imaes of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. a discrinative ai model could be trained on a datase of images of cats and odgs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

What are large language models (LLMs)?
An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-quality text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used for many tasks, such as writing, translating, and coding.

What are some of the challenges of using LLMs? Select three options.
They can be expensive to train.
They can be used to generate harmful content.
They can be biased.

What are some of the applications of LLMs?
LLMs can be used for many tasks, including writing, translating, and coding.

What is a benefit of using large language models (LLMs)?
They can generate human-quality text for tasks such as content creation, writing assistance, and automatic summarization.
