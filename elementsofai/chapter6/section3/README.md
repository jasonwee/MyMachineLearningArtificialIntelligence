work: probably AI help to solve things i may not able to, I said probably because some time AI does not understand my situation and thus giving wrong advice. But some times it help to solve my problems and I tend to depend on it that eventually my thinking skill become rusty.

life: AI will improve productivity and may help to solve things that I need help in daily life, like cooking, medication questionaire, fixing houses, etc. If I dependend too much on AI giving answer, I lost thinking skill like I mentioned previously and also social communcation skill sets too.
