This article explain what is RL, where to apply RL to, and the algorithm used by RL, and where to begin to learn about RL.

To quote a paragraph from the article

```
As compared to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is different in terms of goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, in the case of reinforcement learning the goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. The figure below illustrates the action-reward feedback loop of a generic RL model.

It is accurate that, Unsupervised learning focuses on understanding and modeling the structure of data, typically by finding patterns such as clusters or associations whilst Reinforcement learning (RL) focuses on learning to make sequential decisions to maximize cumulative rewards.
